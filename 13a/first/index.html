    <p>Oh, ow! Who's that then? Why do you think that she is a witch? We found
    them. Where'd you get the coconuts? It's only a model. I have to push the
    pram a lot. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the
    enchanter who lives beyond these woods. The swallow may fly south with the
    sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter,
    yet these are not strangers to our land. You don't vote for kings. Bring
    her forward! I have to push the pram a lot.</p>


    <p>It's only a model. I dunno. Must be a king. The Lady of the Lake, her
    arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the
    bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to
    carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. What a strange person. Burn
    her! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Burn her! But you are
    dressed as oneâ€¦ Why do you think that she is a witch? What a strange
    person. What do you mean? Burn her anyway! Well, she turned me into a newt.
    No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Be quiet! Oh! Come and
    see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed!
    The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! She looks like one.</p>
