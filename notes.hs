-- Integer will expand as much as needed (like a bignum or whatever
-- that is), within (memory) limits.

-- Int is limited to usually either 32 or 64 (in every implementation,
-- at least 30) bits.

-- Just x -- this means that x is a thing!
-- bool is implemented basically as: Bool = True | false
-- maybe a = Nothing | Just a
