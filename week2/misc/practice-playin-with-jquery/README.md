This is a super simple project to practice JQuery. I think it would be cool if people added their own ideas to it. It's basically just a grid of a bunch of boxes made from DIVs and some simple starting JQuery.

This is some silly text from Miles ; )

Hopefully this works! If not, blame David. And Google.

For the terminal-friendly (not terminally friendly), Github has [their own version](https://hub.github.com/) of the Git client, which adds `fork`, `create`, `browse`, `compare`, `release`, `ci-status`, `issue`, `release`, and (most importantly) `pull-request` to git; there are other wrappers that make git friendlier (`npm i -g gh` will get you one, for example), but `hub` is pretty great because all it does is add on a bit of Github-related functionality.
