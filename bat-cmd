trying this in bat first, because (vanilla) electron failed me miserably last  
time around. it's already a little bit better... though for whatever reason,  
some file paths just don't work. like, the ones that include views. or  
markdown. BUT the css and js work just fine. HMMM.

anyway, this is the command for running bat (assuming you have it globally installed)

`bat --title markvi --size 1200x800 --debug -d ./index.html`
