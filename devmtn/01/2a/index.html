      <h2>Hello! And welcome to <em>Ze Neuz</em></h2>
      <div class="article">
        <strong>This right here is a rather catching headline</strong>, don't you think?

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who,
            in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the
            finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison
            and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

        <p><a href="#">Well, the way they make shows is</a>, they make one show.
                    <img class="stuck" src="apt.png" title="Apt; Get Into It">
            That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
            people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked
            and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

        <strong>And whaddaya know, it's ANOTHER darned news story!</strong>

        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the
            arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known
            way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I
            do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get
            some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

        <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How it's possible, how it's
            done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call
            it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know? If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it
            means we never made it back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic. </p>

        <p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they
            haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people. <a href="http://linkythel.ink">
            Like pit bulls.</a> The dog of dogs. Pit bull can be the right man's best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going to give
            me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right, Omar? Give me Raoul. </p>
