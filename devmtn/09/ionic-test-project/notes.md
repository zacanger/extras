We're getting a little super-fast (read: unplanned and, I think, unannounced) rundown on Ionic. Which is totally fine, but it's basically Angular, plus Phonegap, which are two things I rather dislike.

Okay, I'm using the Yeoman generator-ionic-gulp seed.

Aaaaand this is just like Angular, except with predefined CSS rules, basically. The 'magic' is all in the bit where it handles compiling/wrapping for you. So... on with my personal project, I suppose.
