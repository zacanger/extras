workflow: have a project. have a git repo in it. `heroku create`, assuming you use/have heroku.
(same as `git remote add heroku https://someurl.herokuapp.com`)

digital ocean: works the same as ever, which is to say, it's not convenient, but it it's okay. prefer koding if they let me back in, but if not, maybe using codeanywhere/codenvy/c9/any one of the other IDEs with built in dev servers.
