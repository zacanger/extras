if a div has position absolute, position RELATIVE on another element will be in RELATION to the div that has ABSOLUTE.

so, top 0 is in RELATION to something else that has ABSOLUTE, otherwise just defaults to in relative to HTML.

in simpler terms... position is basically just referring to its immediate parent, unless there's no frame of reference there. all hierarchical. (lol hence C in CSS....)

box-model:
- border goes OUTwards from the element
- padding goes IN and squishes the element
- LOTS of padding will actually stretch an element out
- margins--space between picture and other items
