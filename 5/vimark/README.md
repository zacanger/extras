this is a possible part of my no-server project at @devmountain

based on [this tutorial series](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/creating-a-web-app-from-scratch-using-angularjs-and-firebase--cms-717), modified to actually work with current libraries (still need to switch to ui-router), and eventually intended as the platform that'll serve to showcase [markvi](https://github.com/zacanger/markvi).

probably not exactly useable at the moment. clone at your own peril. feel free to fork. any and all PRs welcome. see <http://zacanger.com/blog/no-server-projects.html> for a rough sketch of current and long-term dev plans.
