bits, bobs, et-ceteras, and all the rest

mostly small samples and test projects used to learn each of these technologies

since each framework/lib/project only has one sample/subdirectory here, i'm not breaking them each out into individual repos

see devmtn repo for actual school things

see markvi, ayuba, and github.com/pharaoh-js for large projects

see individual named repos for all the rest
