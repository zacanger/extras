* webapp for tweeting code snippets as images
* (alternatives: unicode/punycode? expanding text snippets?)
* interface: simple editor widget (codemirror/ace/anything?).
  enter text, generates image.
direct tweeting?
* php/codemirror/ace/prism/what else, for options, here?
* limit to ~500 chars?
* maybe could use the old (my old) php pastebin's flat-file database sorta thing
