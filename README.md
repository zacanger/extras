# lesswm

Less is not more. Just enough window management for X11.

WIP Tiling window manager. Fork of <https://github.com/DebianJoe/hcwm>.

* To run, `make run`
* To stop running, `make stop`

## TODO

* Accept a simple config file, either INI format or YAML
* Bar support
* Focus follows mouse
* That's it
