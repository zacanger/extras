based on @divshot's markdown sample project  
getting some practice in with the angular and such  
deconstructing  

plans:
  * rewrite parser (markdown-extra-ish)
  * something like jsvi, but with a bit less vi-ness
  * maybe move whole thing to coffeescript, stylus, & jade eventually?
  * get all that done by, like, next week
uuuuhhh...

i totally got this, right?
