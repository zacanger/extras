A tiny Scheme-alike in JS, just for fun.

The core is originally based on
[littlelisp](https://github.com/maryrosecook/littlelisp).

To use: `node repl.js`, or `node . [file]`

## TODO:

* Implement primitives (in js):
  * def
  * apply
  * pair
  * list
  * quot
* Get small stdlib working (in lsp)
* Handle newlines in files
* Make repl actually work
