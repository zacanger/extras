Less is not more

WIP Tiling window manager. Fork of <https://github.com/DebianJoe/hcwm>. See
./readme-original.md for details on that one's design decisions.

* To run, `make run`
* To stop running, `make stop`

## TODO

* Accept a simple config file, either INI format or YAML
* Port to Go if there's good X bindings, Python otherwise
* Bar support
* Stability
* Focus follows mouse
* Keybinds to focus
* That's it
