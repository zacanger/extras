WOW that was half a hassle, just to fork my own repo. For future reference: fresh repo (on gh first or publish the long way), add original repo as upstream, pull upstream, push origin. it's not perfect, but it worked, kind of.

### OKAY

### WELCOME TO MY AS_-YET-UNNAMED-BLOGGING-APP
This was pulled from the electron-testing branch of https://github.com/zacanger/markvi  
Rather than push that editor into a whole new project, I do believe I'll maintain and update it as needed/desired, and use that as the main editing component of THIS project.

#### So... what is this, exactly?
Well, it's a thing I'm making!
	- based on markvi (which is, as the name kind of implies, a markdown editor with vi keybinds)
	- also based on lots of stuff written by people like [Paul Ford](http://ftrain.com)
	- plus other equally white- and generic-sounding persons
	- and anyone who has ever thought or talked about (or blogged about) [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=blogging+is+dead)
	- with a super antisocial aesthetic very much inspired by [pinboard](https://pinboard.in)
	- with no social sharing widgets, like buttons, follows, stars, hearts, or any of that touchy-feely ADD sesame street bulls- stuff.
	- oh, and it's not in a browser, which is kind of the point, actually.

Browsers are awesome. What's not awesome is having twenty (or two hundred) tabs open, needing to share every bit of interesting 'content' on every social media platform, and thinking more about the comments and the likes than the writing. This whole shindig runs on the desktop, albiet in [Electron](https://electron.atom.io), because... browsers really are awesome.

Anyhow! Welcome to my app. I wouldn't risk trying to use it, yet. It might eat your computer. More likely it'll just not work at all, but you never know, right?
