a simple, beautiful markdown editor with a realtime preview pane  
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  
plans:
  * rewrite parser (markdown-extra-ish) (far future)
  * something like jsvi, but with a bit less vi-ness (that is, i just want some good keybinds, here)
  * maybe move whole thing to coffeescript, stylus, & jade eventually?
	* desktop client (electron with photon, or something based on bat?)
	* integration with my rough attempt at a blog platform
