No `if...else` in JSX. Doesn't work. Don't do it. It's idiotic as fuck, but that's the way it is.

Don't even attempt a `<!doctype>`. Not worth the fuss, since React will just break everything. Stupid as all fucking hell.

No HTML comments. None. Zero. Don't do it. JSX will bite your head off, chew it up, spit it out, and then probably get sick all over you.

Don't have any preferences for code style. JSX will break. Using React means doing it _their way_. Which means goddamn motherfucking semicolon abuse. Semicolons everywhere. Goddammit. That's some really dumb shit.

Every single little bitch-ass HTML tag needs to be closed in JSX. Hence the really fucking stupid shit like `<fuckEVERYTHINGiHATEmyLIFE lotsofjavascripthere />`. Self-closing tags (which are literally not even a thing in HTML, you fucking idiots!) are equally as valid as actual closing tags, so you can do super fucked-up shit like `<div />`.

Goddamn, JSX is bad. I really hate this.
