first off, wtf is typescript even

just use react and es6 like a real person

secondly, i'm doing this because i'm so fucking sick of looking at other peoples' css and i need something entertaining to do, like writing hideous horrible shit in a language that has no right to exist.

thirdly, fuck typescript, really, what? and angular2, for that matter. can't fix your shit this late, angular. fuck off.
