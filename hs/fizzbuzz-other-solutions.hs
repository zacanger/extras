{-
Fizz comes before Buzz comes before an integer. Fizz and Buzz stick to each other, but hide integers.
The lists for Fizz and Buzz are infinite, but zipping together with a finite list of integers,
the result is finite.

module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = mapM_ putStrLn $ zipWith3 join (loop 3 "Fizz") (loop 5 "Buzz") [1..100]
  where
    xor s t = if null s then t else s
    loop n s = cycle $ replicate (n-1) [] ++ [s]
    join s t n = xor (s ++ t) (show n)

{-
If one has enabled all warnings as errors, then the integers need an explicit type, as shown below.
The hiding logic can also be implemented by filtering for the first non-null element of a list:
